# need to rearrange stacks of crates.
# have starting config and instruction set for how they will be moved
# what are the crate labels at the top of each stack at the end?
# Sample Input:
#     [D]    
# [N] [C]    
# [Z] [M] [P]
#  1   2   3 
#
# move 1 from 2 to 1
# move 3 from 1 to 3
# move 2 from 2 to 1
# move 1 from 1 to 2
